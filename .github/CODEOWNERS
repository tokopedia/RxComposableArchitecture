# Make sure you really understand how to modify this file https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners
# Common mistakes when defining code owners
# 1. Including spaces in path, will result on the whole CODEOWNERS file not working. example: /path/to/folder with spaces/a.txt
# 2. Using wildcard. /foo/bar/* will capture changes in /foo/bar/baz.txt but not in /foo/bar/baz/quux/something.txt
# 3. Forgetting to modify CODEOWNERS when modifying folder structure
