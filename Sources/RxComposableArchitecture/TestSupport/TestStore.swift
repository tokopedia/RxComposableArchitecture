/// A testable runtime for a reducer.
///
/// This object aids in writing expressive and exhaustive tests for features built in the
/// Composable Architecture. It allows you to send a sequence of actions to the store, and each
/// step of the way you must assert exactly how state changed, and how effect emissions were fed
/// back into the system.
///
/// There are multiple ways the test store forces you to exhaustively assert on how your feature
/// behaves:
///
///   * After each action is sent you must describe precisely how the state changed from before
///     the action was sent to after it was sent.
///
///     If even the smallest piece of data differs the test will fail. This guarantees that you
///     are proving you know precisely how the state of the system changes.
///
///   * Sending an action can sometimes cause an effect to be executed, and if that effect emits
///     an action that is fed back into the system, you **must** explicitly assert that you expect
///     to receive that action from the effect, _and_ you must assert how state changed as a
///     result.
///
///     If you try to send another action before you have handled all effect emissions the
///     assertion will fail. This guarantees that you do not accidentally forget about an effect
///     emission, and that the sequence of steps you are describing will mimic how the application
///     behaves in reality.
///
///   * All effects must complete by the time the assertion has finished running the steps you
///     specify.
///
///     If at the end of the assertion there is still an in-flight effect running, the assertion
///     will fail. This helps exhaustively prove that you know what effects are in flight and
///     forces you to prove that effects will not cause any future changes to your state.
///
/// For example, given a simple counter reducer:
///
///     struct CounterState {
///       var count = 0
///     }
///
///     enum CounterAction: Equatable {
///       case decrementButtonTapped
///       case incrementButtonTapped
///     }
///
///     let counterReducer = Reducer<CounterState, CounterAction, Void> { state, action, _ in
///       switch action {
///       case .decrementButtonTapped:
///         state.count -= 1
///         return .none
///
///       case .incrementButtonTapped:
///         state.count += 1
///         return .none
///       }
///     }
///
/// One can assert against its behavior over time:
///
///     class CounterTests: XCTestCase {
///       func testCounter() {
///         let store = TestStore(
///           initialState: .init(count: 0),     // GIVEN counter state of 0
///           reducer: counterReducer,
///           environment: ()
///         )
///         store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) { // WHEN the increment button is tapped
///           $0.count = 1                       // THEN the count should be 1
///         }
///       }
///     }
///
/// Note that in the trailing closure of `.send(.incrementButtonTapped)` we are given a single
/// mutable value of the state before the action was sent, and it is our job to mutate the value
/// to match the state after the action was sent. In this case the `count` field changes to `1`.
///
/// For a more complex example, consider the following bare-bones search feature that uses the
/// `.debounce` operator to wait for the user to stop typing before making a network request:
///
///     struct SearchState: Equatable {
///       var query = ""
///       var results: [String] = []
///     }
///
///     enum SearchAction: Equatable {
///       case queryChanged(String)
///       case response([String])
///     }
///
///     struct SearchEnvironment {
///       var mainQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>
///       var request: (String) -> Effect<[String], Never>
///     }
///
///     let searchReducer = Reducer<SearchState, SearchAction, SearchEnvironment> {
///       state, action, environment in
///
///         enum SearchId {}
///
///         switch action {
///         case let .queryChanged(query):
///           state.query = query
///           return environment.request(self.query)
///             .debounce(id: SearchId.self, for: 0.5, scheduler: environment.mainQueue)
///
///         case let .response(results):
///           state.results = results
///           return .none
///         }
///     }
///
/// It can be fully tested by controlling the environment's scheduler and effect:
///
///     // Create a test dispatch scheduler to control the timing of effects
///     let scheduler = DispatchQueue.testScheduler
///
///     let store = TestStore(
///       initialState: SearchState(),
///       reducer: searchReducer,
///       environment: SearchEnvironment(
///         // Wrap the test scheduler in a type-erased scheduler
///         mainQueue: scheduler.eraseToAnyScheduler(),
///         // Simulate a search response with one item
///         request: { _ in Effect(value: ["Composable Architecture"]) }
///       )
///     )
///
///     // Change the query
///     store.send(.searchFieldChanged("c") {
///       // Assert that state updates accordingly
///       $0.query = "c"
///     }
///
///     // Advance the scheduler by a period shorter than the debounce
///     scheduler.advance(by: 0.25)
///
///     // Change the query again
///     store.send(.searchFieldChanged("co") {
///       $0.query = "co"
///     }
