  /// There are two ways to define a reducer:
  ///
  ///   1. You can either implement the ``reduce(into:action:)-4nzr2`` method, which is given direct
  ///      mutable access to application ``State`` whenever an ``Action`` is fed into the system,
  ///      and returns an ``Effect`` that can communicate with the outside world and feed additional
  ///      ``Action``s back into the system.
  ///
  ///   2. Or you can implement the ``body-swift.property-7foai`` property, which combines one or
  ///      more reducers together.
  ///
  /// At most one of these requirements should be implemented. If a conformance implements both
  /// requirements, only ``reduce(into:action:)-4nzr2`` will be called by the ``Store``. If your
  /// reducer assembles a body from other reducers _and_ has additional business logic it needs to
  /// layer onto the feature, introduce this logic into the body instead, either with ``Reduce``:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// var body: some ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///   Reduce { state, action in
  ///     // extra logic
  ///   }
  ///   Activity()
  ///   Profile()
  ///   Settings()
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ...or with a separate, dedicated conformance:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// var body: some ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///   Core()
  ///   Activity()
  ///   Profile()
  ///   Settings()
  /// }
  /// struct Core: ReducerProtocol<State, Action> {
  ///   // extra logic

  /// ```
  ///
  /// If you are implementing a custom reducer operator that transforms an existing reducer,
  /// _always_ invoke the ``reduce(into:action:)-4nzr2`` method, never the
  /// ``body-swift.property-7foai``. For example, this operator that logs all actions sent to the
