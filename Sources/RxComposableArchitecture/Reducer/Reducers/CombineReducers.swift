//     `buildFinalResult` to erase to `Reduce`, avoiding the issue.

/// Combines multiple reducers into a single reducer.

/// `CombineReducers` takes a block that can combine a number of reducers using a
/// ``ReducerBuilder``.

/// Useful for grouping reducers together and applying reducer modifiers to the result.
