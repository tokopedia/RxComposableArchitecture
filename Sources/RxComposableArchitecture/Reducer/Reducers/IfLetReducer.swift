        This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

        • A parent reducer set child state to "nil" before this reducer ran. This reducer must \
        run before any other reducer sets child state to "nil". This ensures that child reducers \
        can handle their actions while their state is still available.

        • An in-flight effect emitted this action when child state was "nil". While it may be \
        perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the associated effect \
        before child state becomes "nil", especially if it is a long-living effect.

        • This action was sent to the store while state was "nil". Make sure that actions for this \
        reducer can only be sent from a view store when state is non-"nil". In SwiftUI \
        applications, use "IfLetStore".
