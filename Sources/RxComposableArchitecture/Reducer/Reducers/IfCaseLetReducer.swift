        An "ifCaseLet" at "%@:%d" received a child action when child state was set to a different \
        case. …

          Action:
            %@
          State:
            %@

        This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen for a few reasons:

        • A parent reducer set "%@" to a different case before this reducer ran. This reducer must \
        run before any other reducer sets child state to a different case. This ensures that child \
        reducers can handle their actions while their state is still available.

        • An in-flight effect emitted this action when child state was unavailable. While it may \
        be perfectly reasonable to ignore this action, consider canceling the associated effect \
        before child state changes to another case, especially if it is a long-living effect.

        • This action was sent to the store while state was another case. Make sure that actions \
        for this reducer can only be sent from a view store when state is set to the appropriate \
        case. In SwiftUI applications, use "SwitchStore".
